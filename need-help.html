            <p>
                If you've forgotten your password, follow these simple steps to regain
                access to your account:
            </p>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Request a Password Reset Link</h2>
                <p>
                    Enter your registered email address below, and we’ll send you a
                    password reset link. Click the link in the email to reset your
                    password securely.
                </p>
                <form action="#" method="POST">
                    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required placeholder="Enter your email" />

            <section>
                <h2>2. Create a New Password</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you receive the reset link, click on it, and you will be
                    redirected to a page where you can create a new password. For your
                    security, your new password must meet the following criteria:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 8 characters long.</li>
                    <li>Includes both uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
                    <li>Contains at least one number.</li>
                    <li>Has at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %).</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Secure Your Account</h2>
                <p>
                    After resetting your password, it's important to follow additional
                    steps to secure your account:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This will
                        add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of
                        verification (such as a code sent to your phone or email).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Review Recent Login Activity:</strong> Check your
                        account’s login history to ensure that no unauthorized users have
                        accessed your account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Update Security Questions:</strong> If applicable, update
                        your account's security questions to ensure they’re unique and
                        difficult for others to guess.
                    </li>

                <h2>Tips for Keeping Your Password Secure</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> A password manager can
                        securely store your passwords and generate strong, unique
                        passwords for each of your accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Don't Share Your Password:</strong> Never share your
                        password with anyone, not even friends or family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Public Wi-Fi networks
                        are more vulnerable to hackers. Avoid logging in to sensitive
                        accounts when connected to public Wi-Fi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Change Your Password Regularly:</strong> Set a reminder to
                        change your passwords periodically, ideally every 3-6 months.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be Wary of Phishing Scams:</strong> Always verify the
                        source of any email or message before clicking on any links or
                        downloading attachments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Don’t Use the Same Password Everywhere:</strong> If one of
                        your accounts is compromised, it puts all your other accounts at
                        risk if you use the same password.

                    <li>
                        Log out of all sessions and re-login using your new password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check your account activity for any unauthorized actions or
                        changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your email is also compromised, change the password for your
                        email account as well.

                <h2>Understanding Password Security Risks</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to securing your account, understanding potential
                    risks is crucial:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Breaches:</strong> If a website you use experiences a
                        data breach, your password may be exposed. It’s important to
                        change your password regularly and keep track of security
                        incidents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Brute-Force Attacks:</strong> Attackers use automated
                        systems to guess passwords by trying various combinations. Strong
                        passwords help protect you from such attacks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Hackers may attempt to trick
                        you into revealing your password through fake emails or phone
                        calls. Always verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive
                        information.
